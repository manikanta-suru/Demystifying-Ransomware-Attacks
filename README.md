# Demystifying Ransomware Attacks: Unveiling the Role of RDP 🌐🔒

In the realm of cybersecurity, Ransomware attacks exploit Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), constituting 95% of incidents in 2023 (source: Sophos). Learn the attack flow and fortify your defenses.

## Attack Flow

1. **Infiltration Begins: Scanning for Vulnerabilities 🎯**
   - Attackers scan IP ranges for open RDP ports (e.g., 3389) exposed to the internet.

2. **Breaching the Gates: Unauthorized RDP Access 🕵️**
   - Initiating attempts to breach the system via RDP after identifying a vulnerable target.

3. **The Brute Force Gambit 🔐**
   - Exploiting local user accounts through brute force attacks, using common usernames and easily guessable passwords.

4. **Diverse Credential Harvesting 🌐**
   - Deploying various tactics to acquire login credentials, from dark web purchases to phishing attacks.

5. **Seizing Control: Compromising the System 💻🔓**
   - Gaining control without physical presence, setting the stage for the ultimate act.

6. **Unleashing Ransomware: Network Propagation ⚔️**
   - Deploying ransomware from the compromised system to initiate an automated scan across the network.

## Defensive Measures

1. **Fortify Your Perimeter: RDP Management 🚫**
   - Turn off RDP if not imperative. If needed, shield it behind a VPN for added security.

2. **Restrict Access: Administrator Groups 🛑**
   - Remove local Administrators group from RDP access to prevent exploitation.

3. **Strengthen Passwords: Avoid Guessable Defaults 🔐**
   - Eliminate guessable passwords, especially for local accounts. Use Windows LAPS for enhanced security.

4. **Vigilant Monitoring: Identify Threats Early 🕵️‍♂️**
   - Watch for successive failed login attempts (Windows Event ID 4625) to detect and respond promptly.

## Conclusion

In the battle against ransomware, understanding the pivotal role of RDP is paramount. Implement these measures to fortify your defenses and stay vigilant. Stay secure! 🌐🔒
